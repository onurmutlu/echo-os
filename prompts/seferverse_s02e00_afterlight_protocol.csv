1,afterlight_intro,"[SCENE] Balkız stands on the same rooftop as last season's epilogue; dawn filters through neon haze above DeltaNova. A faint holographic silhouette of Karat flickers in distant glass. [CONTINUITY] Same skyline, Balkız signature outfit, color motif blue/white with subtle red accents. [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, high contrast, shallow DOF, soft dawn backlighting with neon remnants. [DISALLOW] no text, no watermark, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.6,""surreal"":0.7,""documentary"":0.8},""emotional_palette"":[""dawn"",""continuity""]}"
2,street_echo,"[SCENE] Ground-level alley: rain-slick pavement reflecting neon; Balkız touches a wall of holographic glyphs—city memory responding like a quiet choir. Drone sentries hover far above. [CONTINUITY] Same outfit, skyline peeks through alley opening, color palette consistent. [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, shallow DOF, high contrast, soft shadows with neon bounce. [DISALLOW] no text, no watermark, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.4,""surreal"":0.8,""documentary"":0.7},""emotional_palette"":[""memory"",""echo""]}"
3,altar_of_noise,"[SCENE] Interior—abandoned data substation that looks like a 'digital altar'; fiber strands hang from ceiling like threads of light. Balkız holds the data capsule at chest level. Karat appears only as a faint reflection on a server panel. [CONTINUITY] Same outfit/props; skyline implied via window slits. [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, high contrast, dawn backlight through vents, soft shadows. [DISALLOW] no text, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.5,""surreal"":0.9,""documentary"":0.6},""emotional_palette"":[""sacred"",""digital""]}"
4,memory_market,"[SCENE] Overlook—DeltaNova's rooftops as 'memory stalls': holographic fragments drifting like slow flags. Balkız scans them with palm HUD. [CONTINUITY] Same skyline, same outfit, blue/white motif persists. [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, shallow DOF, rim lighting from dawn, soft neon underglow. [DISALLOW] no text, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.6,""surreal"":0.8,""documentary"":0.7},""emotional_palette"":[""market"",""memory""]}"
5,signal_sabotage,"[SCENE] A sudden interference wave cuts across the city; neon signs stutter. Balkız braces on a catwalk as red control lines attempt to overwrite blue/white signal threads. Karat's silhouette sharpens briefly on a glass tower far away. [CONTINUITY] Same skyline/costume; palette tension (blue/white vs red). [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, high contrast, dynamic backlight, shallow DOF. [DISALLOW] no text, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.3,""surreal"":0.7,""documentary"":0.8},""emotional_palette"":[""tension"",""conflict""]}"
6,rooftop_alignment,"[SCENE] Rooftop close-up: Balkız aligns the data capsule with the horizon; light threads connect capsule to multiple buildings like quiet prayers. [CONTINUITY] Outfit/props persistent; skyline continuous. [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, shallow DOF, dawn rim light, soft shadows. [DISALLOW] no text, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.7,""surreal"":0.6,""documentary"":0.8},""emotional_palette"":[""alignment"",""prayer""]}"
7,heartbeat_protocol,"[SCENE] Wide shot above the city: pulses ripple out from Balkız in concentric rings—each pulse dims red control lines and strengthens blue/white threads. Karat's reflection breaks into harmless fragments. [CONTINUITY] Same skyline; motif maintained. [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, high contrast, shallow DOF, backlighting creates halo edges. [DISALLOW] no text, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.5,""surreal"":0.9,""documentary"":0.6},""emotional_palette"":[""pulse"",""protocol""]}"
8,grace_update,"[SCENE] Quiet terrace: Balkız rests the capsule on a ledge; threads retract into the city grid. The neon glow subsides into soft daylight. [CONTINUITY] Outfit unchanged; skyline consistent; palette shifts gently to daylight while retaining motif accents. [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, shallow DOF, soft shadows, gentle fill. [DISALLOW] no text, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.8,""surreal"":0.4,""documentary"":0.7},""emotional_palette"":[""grace"",""peace""]}"
9,epilogue_echo,"[SCENE] Final rooftop sit: Balkız in profile, looking over DeltaNova now calm. A faint, benign holographic echo of Karat drifts like morning mist and dissolves. [CONTINUITY] Same skyline/outfit; stable daylight, motif resolved. [CAMERA/LIGHT] 35mm, high contrast with soft morning light, shallow DOF. [DISALLOW] no text, no logos, no extra people.","{""weights"":{""warmth"":0.7,""surreal"":0.6,""documentary"":0.8},""emotional_palette"":[""resolution"",""echo""]}"
